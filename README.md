The explanation for each solution:

# Schema Validation  
### [shema_validation/schme_valtidation.py]

This solution validates a JSON structure containing internet hubs and assigns serial numbers based on specific criteria. First, the data is checked against a schema to ensure it follows the required format. If valid, each hub is assigned a unique serial number from a predefined range, ordered based on the last digit in each hubâ€™s ID.

The main function, validate_and_assign_serial_numbers, combines validation and assignment. If everything is correct, it returns the updated JSON data with assigned serial numbers; otherwise, it provides an error message explaining any issues. This approach keeps the data organized and ensures each hub gets a valid, unique serial number.

# Hypthetical Service
### [hypothetical_service/hypothetical.py]

This solution defines a Python script to retrieve customer address data from an API, validate it, and save it in a CSV file. The `get_customer_numbers` function fetches the total count of customer records, and `get_address` retrieves address details for each customer based on their ID. To ensure data quality, the `validate_address` function checks each address entry for required fields, returning `False` if any field is missing or `None`. The `retrieve_addresses` function iterates through all customer numbers, validating and storing each address in a list. If an error occurs during retrieval or validation, the error message is printed, ensuring the script continues to process remaining customer data.

The `save_addresses_to_csv` function converts the validated addresses list into a DataFrame and saves it as a CSV file. The main function coordinates these steps, calling each helper function, saving the CSV file, and printing the file's absolute path for user access. The main function also displays the list of addresses in a table format using `pandas.DataFrame`. This modular approach enables easy data management and ensures that each function has a focused responsibility, making the code readable and maintainable.

# Question Parser App
### [cbt_app]


This Django solution allows users to upload a PDF of multiple-choice questions, parse the content, preview the extracted questions, and then confirm to save them into the database. The solution consists of three main parts: models, forms, and views. The models (`SubjectCategoryMapping`, `Subjects`, `Answers`, and `Question`) represent different components of a quiz question (like categories, subjects, answers, and question details) and allow storing data in the database. The form `QuestionUploadForm` enables users to select a PDF file and choose the subject and category for the questions in the PDF.

The views handle the main functionality. In `upload_questions`, the PDF file is read, and questions are extracted and stored in the session for previewing. The `PreviewQuestions` view then displays these questions in a preview template, allowing users to review them. After confirmation, the questions are saved to the database. Additionally, a loading spinner and overlay effect are implemented in the HTML template to show users a loading screen upon submission, providing feedback and preventing multiple submissions.
